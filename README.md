# Electric Vehicle Charging Stations

Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (evChargers) is a project developed in collaboration between Dr. Henricus Bouwmeester and Jason Carey. EVCS is meant to show an application of machine learning techniques to predict optimal charging station locations for electric vehicles in Colorado. Our predictions are based on multiple factors including:
- Pre-existing and planned locations for charging stations
- Density of actively registered electric vehicles in the area
- Poisson Processes for charging station usage

# Data

Data used within the EVCS project are sourced from multiple online resources listed below:
- Electric Vehicle Registrations
    - The Colorado Energy Office [CEO](https://energyoffice.colorado.gov/), however, maintained and distributed by [Atlas EV Hub](https://www.atlasevhub.com/).
- Electric Vehicle Charging Stations
    - The US Department of Energy [USDE](https://afdc.energy.gov/).

# Delivery

EVCS is planned to be delivered as a `Dash` application. You can access the application through the following link:
